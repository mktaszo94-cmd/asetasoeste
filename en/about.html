      <p>
        The West Zone Darts Association was founded from a shared passion for the sport of darts and the desire to bring together players, teams, and enthusiasts from the Oeste region into a strong, inclusive, and growing project.

      <p>
        More than just a sports association, we are a community that promotes social interaction, sportsmanship, and personal development through the practice of darts, valuing both competitive play and recreational enjoyment. We work daily to create opportunities, organize events, and strengthen the sport in our region, always guided by the principles of fair play, mutual respect, and friendship.

      <p>
        We believe that sport has the power to bring people together, build connections, and contribute to a more active, healthy, and engaged society.
